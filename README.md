# Spoken-Digit-Recognitin-using-HMM
The spoken digit recognition system uses Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients to extract speech features and the Hidden Markov Model classifier for recognition.
The dataset comprises of 750 .wav file collected from 5 speakers. Each speaker recorded 15 samples of each digit from 0 through 9 to account for variation.
Python based API called hmmlearn has been used to build the model.
